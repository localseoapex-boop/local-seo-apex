/**
 * offices.ts — physical office locations (requirement #5: multiple offices).
 *
 * Each office is a real place with its own NAP (Name/Address/Phone), hours, and
 * the set of city slugs it serves. This is the source of truth for:
 *   - the multi-node LocalBusiness schema (one node per office)
 *   - the footer's per-office NAP blocks
 *   - the "serving office" phone shown on each city/location-service page
 *
 * `primaryOffice` (offices[0]) feeds the org-level BUSINESS defaults in
 * src/config/site.ts, so there's no duplicated business data anywhere.
 *
 * NOTE: Load Logic's Mesa street address is pending final move-in, so `street`
 * and `postalCode` are intentionally omitted. The footer and LocalBusiness
 * schema render the address with addressLocality ("Mesa") + region ("AZ") only,
 * which is the correct, Google-safe state until the full address is published.
