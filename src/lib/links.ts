/**
 * links.ts — internal-linking helpers (requirement #4).
 *
 * Internal linking is how programmatic-SEO sites pass relevance between pages
 * and help crawlers discover hundreds of URLs. These pure functions answer the
 * questions every template asks:
 *
 *   - relatedServices(slug)      → "Related services" block
 *   - nearbyCities(slug)         → "Nearby cities" block
 *   - locationsForService(slug)  → "Available in these areas" (related locations)
 *   - servicesForLocation(loc)   → which services a city offers
 *
 * Keeping this logic out of the templates means every page links consistently
 * and the rules live in one testable place.
